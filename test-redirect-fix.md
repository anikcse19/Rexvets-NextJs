# Admin Redirect Fix - Test Instructions

## Issue
The sign-in page was not redirecting admin users immediately after successful authentication. Users had to refresh the page to see the session update and get redirected.

## Solution
Updated the sign-in logic to use `window.location.href` for immediate redirection when the redirect parameter is `/admin/overview`, bypassing the session update issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Credentials Sign-In
- Check if `redirect === "/admin/overview"`
- Use `window.location.href = "/admin/overview"` for immediate redirect
- Fall back to normal router.push for other redirects

### 2. Updated Google Sign-In
- Same logic as credentials sign-in
- Immediate redirect for admin overview

### 3. Updated Middleware
- Added redirect parameter when redirecting to sign-in page
- Ensures the redirect parameter is preserved

## Test Steps

1. **Start the development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create a test admin user**:
   ```bash
   node test-admin-redirect.js
   ```

3. **Test Direct Admin Access**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001/admin/overview` (note: port 3001, not 3000)
   - Should redirect to `http://localhost:3001/auth/signin?redirect=/admin/overview`

4. **Test Admin Sign-In**:
   - On the sign-in page, enter admin credentials:
     - Email: `admin@test.com`
     - Password: `AdminTest123!`
   - Click "Sign In to RexVet"
   - **Expected**: Immediate redirect to `http://localhost:3001/admin/overview`

5. **Test Google Sign-In** (if you have a Google account with admin role):
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Complete Google authentication
   - **Expected**: Immediate redirect to admin overview

## Key Benefits

✅ **Immediate Redirection**: No more waiting or page refresh needed
✅ **Reliable**: Uses `window.location.href` which always works
✅ **Preserves Redirect Parameter**: Middleware ensures redirect is maintained
✅ **Works for Both Sign-In Methods**: Credentials and Google OAuth

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Checking if the redirect parameter is `/admin/overview`
2. Using `window.location.href` for immediate navigation (bypasses React Router)
3. This ensures the redirect happens even if the session hasn't updated yet
4. The middleware will handle the authentication check on the admin page

This approach is more reliable than trying to update the session and then redirect, as it doesn't depend on the session state being immediately available.
