# Sign-In Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The sign-in page was not redirecting admin users immediately after successful authentication. Users had to refresh the page to see the session update and get redirected.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Immediate Session Check**: After successful authentication, we now immediately fetch the updated session data
2. **Direct Redirection**: Based on the user role from the fresh session data, we redirect immediately
3. **Removed useEffect Dependency**: No longer relying on the `useSession` hook's automatic updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `handleSubmit` function
- Added immediate session refresh after successful credentials sign-in
- Fetch updated session data to get user role
- Redirect admin users to `/admin/overview` immediately
- Redirect other users based on the original redirect logic

### 2. Updated `handleGoogleSignIn` function
- Added immediate session refresh after successful Google sign-in
- Fetch updated session data to get user role
- Redirect admin users to `/admin/overview` immediately
- Redirect other users based on the original redirect logic

### 3. Removed unnecessary code
- Removed the `useEffect` that was waiting for session updates
- Removed unused `useSession` import and variables

## Test Instructions

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Create a test admin user**: Run `node test-admin-redirect.js`
3. **Test admin sign-in**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`
   - Sign in with admin credentials (admin@test.com / AdminTest123!)
   - **Expected**: Immediate redirect to `http://localhost:3000/admin/overview`
   - **No page refresh needed**

4. **Test regular user sign-in**:
   - Sign in with non-admin credentials
   - **Expected**: Redirect to the original destination or home page

5. **Test Google sign-in**:
   - Use Google sign-in with an admin account
   - **Expected**: Immediate redirect to admin overview

## Key Benefits

✅ **Immediate Redirection**: No more waiting for page refresh
✅ **Better UX**: Smooth sign-in experience
✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Works for both credentials and Google sign-in
✅ **Role-Based Routing**: Proper admin vs regular user handling

## Technical Details

The fix works by:
1. Using `signIn()` with `redirect: false` to prevent automatic redirects
2. Manually fetching the updated session with `/api/auth/session?update`
3. Checking the user role from the fresh session data
4. Performing the appropriate redirect based on the role

This ensures that the session data is immediately available and the redirection happens without any delays or page refreshes.
